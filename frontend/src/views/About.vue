    <h1>About This Website</h1>
    <p>
      This website is just for fun. I build it when I feel like it and welcome
      contributions to the project from others. I especially take interest in
      testing technologies that make this application better suited to the
      local Vanuatu environment such as offline capabilities and low bandwidth
      usage. I will add more about those details in the future.
